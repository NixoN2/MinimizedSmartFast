# SmartFast
This project is the supporting material of the paper titled "SmartFast: An Accurate and Robust Formal Analysis Tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts", including: datasets, test results, result report, source code, etc.

# Folder introduction

## Dataset1
The folder "Dataset1" includes 149 smart contract files in Dataset_1, and the detection results of each tool.

## Dataset2
The folder "Dataset2" includes 8503 Ethereum smart contract files in Dataset_2, and the detection results of each tool.

## Report
The folder "Report" includes a detailed contract audit report and a simplified contract audit report. From these two reports, we can know **the details of SmartFast's 119 security patterns**. However, the difference between streamlined and detailed: the results of the secure audit mode are not displayed in the streamlined contract audit report. 

## smartfast
The folder "smartfast" includes part of the source code of SmartFast and its installation and usage tutorials. We promise to disclose all the source code when the paper is accepted.

## VulnerabilityMapping
The folder "VulnerabilityMapping" includes the mapping of vulnerabilities detected by tools in 135 vulnerabilities.
